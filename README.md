This website was built on Visual Studio Code using ReactJS. This game displays the names of the players and the symbols X and O. 
In addition, allow the user to edit player names. It also contains a game board, which is a 3x3 grid filled with the symbols X and
O. Finally, this game contains a log below the game board to output information about the turns that the players took while playing
the game. At the end of the game, a pop-up will display the winner's name, or it's a draw if there are no winner, and a rematch 
button will restart the game.
